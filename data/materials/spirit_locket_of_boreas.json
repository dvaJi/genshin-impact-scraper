  "description": "A bit of the Great Wolf King of the North's power drawn from its soul. This land was once a realm of sub-zero blizzards and ice storms filled with razor-sharp ice shards, all at the command of Boreas. In its final moments, it finally realized the chilling north wind could only extinguish life, not nurture it; therefore, Boreas let its powers freely flow into the land to protect it and its inhabitants.",
