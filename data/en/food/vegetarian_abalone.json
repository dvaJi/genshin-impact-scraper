      "description": "A vegetarian dish with a rich flavor. With the aid of the sauce, the matsutake has achieved an excellent, elegant mouth-feel that so rivals scallop in tenderness and abalone in freshness that you can hardly tell them apart. If you left your customer guessing before revealing the truth later, you would be sure to earn their astonished praise.",

      "description": "A vegetarian dish with a rich flavor. The overly thick sauce has totally covered the freshness that the ingredients should have had, and the condiment leaves your mouth dry no matter how much you wash it down with water.",
